This repo contains my personal neovim configuration. To sum it up:
- Plugins are managed with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
- Lazy loading is used extensively to reduce startup times.
- It uses a limited number of plugins; mostly [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) plugins.
- Well thought out keymaps with descriptions.

Is anyone going to use this besides me? Maybe, it's a good config imo...
